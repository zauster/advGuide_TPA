Advanced Guide to TPA: The structural gravity model
========================================

This repository contains the STATA and R code for the examples of the
advanced guide. The guide and the file can be downloaded also from
here: http://vi.unctad.org/tpa/web/vol2/vol2home.html

I add the R code (as currently there is only STATA code) for some of
the applications. See the link below to a full R-translation.
